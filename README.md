Manual Linked List Implementation in Java

This project is a simple, fully manual implementation of a **singly linked list** in Java, without using Java's built-in `LinkedList` class. It's perfect for learning how linked lists work under the hood, and for practicing basic data structure concepts.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `Node.java` â€“ Represents a single node in the linked list.
- `LinkedList.java` â€“ Contains methods for list operations like insertion, deletion, and display.
- `Demo.java` â€“ Runs sample operations to test the list.

ðŸš€ Features

- Insert at the beginning
- Insert at the end
- Insert after a specific key
- Delete from the beginning
- Delete from the end
- Delete by a specific key
- Display the list

ðŸ§  Example Usage

`LinkedList myList = new LinkedList();`  
`myList.insertAtFirst(10);`  
`myList.insertAtLast(20);`  
`myList.insertAfterKey(10, 15);`  
`myList.display(); // Output: 10, 15, 20`
